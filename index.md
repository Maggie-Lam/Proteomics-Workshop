#### Workshop Summary
<p align="justify">
Proteomics is a large-scale analytical approach to examine the functional output of the genome. Many cellular and molecular phenotypes can only be feasibly discerned at the proteomics level, including protein post-translational modifications, protein-protein interactions, protein localization, and more. With maturing technologies, proteomics analysis is now increasingly accessible to biomedical investigators, but sample preparation and data analysis concerns can remain daunting to many potential users. This workshop aims to provide introductory information for researchers interested in performing proteomics experiments as part of their research projects.
</p>
<p align="justify">
The workshop will contain 4 sessions of 2 hours each, consisting of a combination of short lectures combined with practicum sessions designed to familiarize students with general concepts across contemporary large-scale protein detection methods (e.g., shotgun proteomics, RPPA, O-Link, SomaLogic) and experimental strategies (e.g., BioID, APEX, TMT), with emphasis on mass spectrometry-based applications. The practicum sessions will introduce data analysis workflows including the use of common proteomics databases (e.g., UniProt, SwissProt, PRIDE), pathway analysis and enrichment tools (e.g., DAVID and Reactome), protein-protein interaction visualization using Cytoscape, and finally an introduction to R/Bioconductor for visualizing and analyzing proteomics data.
</p>

Upon completing the workshop, students should be able to:
-	Describe common proteomics methods and contrast their uses across research and clinical questions.
-	Discuss basic principles behind mass spectrometry-based protein identification and quantification.
-	Identify sample preparation challenges and objectives for a variety of use cases and scenarios.
-	Utilize common web-based data analysis resources to transform quantitative protein list data to biological hypothesis.
-	Design a hypothetical proteomics experiment working with campus resources to compare protein expression in an animal disease model.
-	Possess basic understanding of scientific programming in R.
